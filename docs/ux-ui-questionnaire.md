## 🎯 **Let's Design Your Portfolio Together**

### 1. **Visual Identity - The Big Question**
Your art suggests you're drawn to **experimental, bold aesthetics**. For your portfolio, should we:

**A) Mirror your glitch-art style?**
- Dark mode with glitch effects, distorted textures, experimental UI
- Bold, unconventional color palette (greens, magentas, cyans)
- Animated noise/grain effects, parallax distortions
- **Vibe:** "This is a developer who thinks differently"

**B) Contrast with clean professionalism?**
- Minimal, elegant design that lets your projects speak
- Clean typography, subtle animations, refined color palette
- **Vibe:** "Serious technical expertise with artistic depth"

**C) Hybrid approach?**
- Professional structure with artistic accents
- Subtle glitch effects, creative hover states, unique typography
- **Vibe:** "Technical excellence meets creative vision"

**Your choice:** _________________

### 2. **Color Palette Direction**
Based on your art, I'm sensing:

**Option A: Dark & Cyberpunk**
- Deep blacks with neon greens, magentas, cyans (like your cross.jpg)
- High contrast, glowing accents
- Matrix/cyberpunk aesthetic

**Option B: Vibrant & Psychedelic**
- Rich purples, greens, reds (like acuarela.png)
- Saturated, bold, energetic
- Experimental and eye-catching

**Option C: Monochrome with Accent**
- Black/white/grays with one bold accent color
- Clean, sophisticated, with artistic flair

**Option D: Adaptive/Toggle**
- Light mode for recruiters, dark mode for developers
- Best of both worlds

**Your preference:** _________________
